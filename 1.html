ITRA is offering a service of certification of the route and evaluation of the difficulty of trail races.<br>
This service is available as of April 17th 2014.<br>
This service will certify the distance, the elevation gains and losses of a trail race and supply an evaluation of the race's difficulty by assessing it on a range from 0 to 6 points.<br>
ITRA will issue a certificate which will allow the organiser to prove the exact distance of their route and/or the number of ITRA points his race has been awarded.<br>
Only trail races (1) may be certified and evaluated.
